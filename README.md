# 755 Final Assignment
Submission for 755's final assignment.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of multiple algorithms learned during the course, we use SQL database and supervised machine learning methods to process a machine learning task. The objective is to apply these tools to a dataset of interest, perform analysis, and document the entire process.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.9**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for documenting code and analysis
- **SQL** for database management, we use SQLite here.
- **Machine Learning Libraries** like `scikit-learn`
- **Quarto** for generate tex and **Overleaf** to convert to PDF.

## File Description
The repository contains the following components:
- `train.csv, test.csv`: containing datasets used for analysis.
- `house_prices_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks with code and analysis.
- `report.pdf`: Final report written using Quarto and Overleaf.

## Methods Used
1. **Supervised Learning**: Implementing models like Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forests.
2. **SQL**: Database creation and querying relevant data for analysis.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/) and includes 79 explanatory variables describing residential homes. The data is processed and analyzed using the methods mentioned above.
